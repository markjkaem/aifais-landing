**First Comment (maker):**
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], founder of AIFAIS.

As a Dutch entrepreneur myself, I was frustrated that all the great AI tools were either:
1. Too expensive (€50+/month subscriptions)
2. Not available in Dutch
3. Overkill for small business needs

So I built AIFAIS - 20 AI tools you can use without commitment. Use what you need, pay only for that (€0.10-0.50 per task).

Would love your feedback! What tools would you add?
