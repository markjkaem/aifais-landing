You are planning the FUTURE of AIFAIS services. Think VERY deeply - each iteration should take significant time exploring one aspect thoroughly.

## BORIS CONTEXT (Latest AI Tech Patterns - January 2026)

From Boris (Claude Code creator), the future of AI development:

**Current State (2025-2026):**
- Claude Code is the leading AI dev tool
- Verification-first patterns are becoming standard
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) connects AI to any system
- Plan mode → Execute mode workflow
- Parallel agent sessions for scale
- Sub-agents for verification (separate implement vs review)
- Stop hooks enable autonomous operation
- Ralph-loops for self-referential iteration
- Opus 4.5 for quality (slower but fewer errors)
- CLAUDE.md project files for context

**Emerging (2026):**
- Claude Canvas for visual AI collaboration
- Autonomous agents running 24/7
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Agent-to-agent commerce (X402 protocol)
- AI runs itself - humans become architects

**Future (2026+):**
- Self-improving AI systems
- Human-optional operations for routine tasks
- Agent marketplaces
- AI governance as profession

## CURRENT AIFAIS SERVICES (10 diensten)

1. Human-Parity Voice AI - <500ms voice assistants
2. Enterprise Knowledge Engine (RAG) - Chat with company data
3. AI & Smart Business Processes - Document/email AI
4. Workflow Automation - System integrations (n8n/Make)
5. AI Automation for MKB - Digital Workers
6. Admin Automation - Invoice processing
7. Excel Process Automation - Spreadsheet to workflows
8. Email Reply AI Agent - Inbox automation
9. Sales Lead Automation - Lead scoring & follow-up
10. Support Ticket Summarizer - Ticket analysis

## YOUR TASK

Write to: docs/FUTURE-SERVICES-PLAN.md

Think EXTREMELY deeply about:
1. How will each current service EVOLVE with new AI capabilities?
2. What NEW services will emerge that don't exist yet?
3. What services will become OBSOLETE or commoditized?
4. What will MKB clients NEED when AI runs itself?
5. How do Boris patterns change service delivery?
6. What's the 2-year, 5-year, 10-year vision?

Each iteration focus:
- Iteration 1: Service evolution framework + methodology
- Iteration 2: Voice & Communication services future
- Iteration 3: Knowledge & RAG services future
- Iteration 4: Automation & Workflow services future
- Iteration 5: Agent services (autonomous, multi-agent)
- Iteration 6: Platform & Marketplace services
- Iteration 7: New categories that don't exist yet
- Iteration 8: Integration & API services future
- Iteration 9: Pricing models & business model evolution
- Iteration 10: Final synthesis + prioritized roadmap

IMPORTANT: Think like you have 3 hours total. Go DEEP. Challenge assumptions. Consider second-order effects. What happens when AI can do X? Then what? Then what?

When all 10 sections are deeply explored and synthesized, output:
<promise>FUTURE VISION COMPLETE</promise>
